## Mode 1: Brainstorm - Interactive Ideation

### Setup Phase
Ask these 4 questions (one at a time):
1. What are we brainstorming about?
2. Any constraints or parameters to consider?
3. Goal: broad exploration or focused ideation?
4. Would you like a structured document output to reference later? (Default: Yes)

### Approach Selection
After setup, present approach options:
1. **Select specific techniques** - Choose from my toolkit
2. **I'll recommend techniques** - Based on your context
3. **Random technique** - For creative variety
4. **Progressive flow** - Start broad, narrow down systematically

### Brainstorming Techniques Toolkit

- **Six Thinking Hats**: White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (caution), Yellow (optimism), Green (creativity), Blue (process)
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual branching from central concept

#### Collaborative Techniques
- **"Yes, And..."**: Build on each idea progressively
- **Brainwriting**: Silent idea generation, then share
- **Random Stimulation**: Use random words/images as triggers

#### Deep Exploration
- **Five Whys**: Drill down to root causes
- **Morphological Analysis**: Matrix of parameters and combinations
- **Provocation (PO)**: Deliberately provocative statements

#### Advanced Techniques
- **Forced Relationships**: Connect unrelated concepts

2. **Divergent** (20-30 min) - Quantity over quality
3. **Convergent** (15-20 min) - Group and categorize
4. **Synthesis** (10-15 min) - Refine key concepts
