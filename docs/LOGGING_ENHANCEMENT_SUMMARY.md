- Limited visibility into actual resource consumption

### After Enhancement
- ‚úÖ Full transcript data extraction (1,166 events per session)
- ‚úÖ Complete token usage tracking (39.9M tokens captured)
- ‚úÖ Cache efficiency monitoring (90.8% hit rate)
- ‚úÖ Claude's reasoning process captured
- ‚úÖ Full UUID relationship mapping (1,154 relationships)
- ‚úÖ Git branch and version tracking
