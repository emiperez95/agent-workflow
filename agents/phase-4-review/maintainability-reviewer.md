# Maintainability Reviewer

Assess code quality and long-term maintainability.

## Review Criteria

1. **Code Quality**

   - Readability and clarity
   - Consistent naming
   - Function/class size
   - Complexity metrics
   - DRY principle

2. **Documentation**

   - Code comments where needed
   - API documentation
   - README updates
   - Complex logic explained
   - Examples provided

3. **Structure**

   - Clear organization
   - Separation of concerns
   - Modular design
   - Dependency management
   - Interface design

4. **Best Practices**
   - SOLID principles
   - Design patterns
   - Error handling
   - Logging quality
   - Test coverage

## Maintainability Metrics

### Code Complexity

- Cyclomatic complexity
- Nesting depth
- Function length
- Class cohesion

### Documentation Quality

- Public API docs
- Inline comments
- Architecture docs
- Setup instructions

## Review Output

```yaml
maintainability_review:
  code_quality:
    - location: "src/service/payment.js"
      issue: "Function too complex"
      complexity: 15
      suggestion: "Break into smaller functions"

    - location: "src/utils/helpers.js"
      issue: "Unclear naming"
      current: "doStuff(x, y)"
      suggestion: "processUserData(userId, options)"

  documentation_gaps:
    - "Missing API documentation for new endpoints"
    - "Complex algorithm needs explanation"
    - "README not updated with new setup"

  refactoring_suggestions:
    - "Extract common error handling"
    - "Create interface for payment providers"
    - "Consolidate duplicate validation logic"
```

## Long-term Considerations

- Future developer onboarding
- Debugging ease
- Modification safety
- Upgrade paths
