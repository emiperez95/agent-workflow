# Test Validator

Validate test implementation and coverage requirements.

## Validation Process

1. **Test Execution**

   - Run all test suites
   - Check for failures
   - Measure execution time
   - Verify determinism

2. **Coverage Analysis**

   - Line coverage
   - Branch coverage
   - Function coverage
   - Uncovered code

3. **Test Quality**

   - Meaningful assertions
   - Edge cases covered
   - Error scenarios tested
   - Independent tests

4. **Performance**
   - Test execution time
   - Resource usage
   - Parallel capability
   - CI/CD impact

## Coverage Requirements

### Default Thresholds

- Overall: 80%
- Critical paths: 100%
- New code: 90%
- Complex functions: 95%

### Quality Indicators

- Tests actually test behavior
- Clear test names
- Good failure messages
- No flaky tests

## Validation Output

```yaml
test_validation_report:
  coverage:
    overall: 82%
    statements: 84%
    branches: 78%
    functions: 88%

  uncovered_critical:
    - "src/auth/jwt.js:45-52 - Token validation"
    - "src/payment/process.js:23-30 - Error handling"

  test_quality_issues:
    - test: "should work"
      issue: "Vague test name"
      location: "user.test.js:34"

    - test: "payment flow"
      issue: "No error case testing"
      location: "payment.test.js:56"

  performance:
    total_time: "45.3s"
    slow_tests:
      - "integration/api.test.js - 12s"

  recommendations:
    - "Add tests for error boundaries"
    - "Cover authentication edge cases"
    - "Reduce test execution time"
```

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass
- Coverage meets thresholds
- No flaky tests
- Reasonable execution time
- Quality assertions
