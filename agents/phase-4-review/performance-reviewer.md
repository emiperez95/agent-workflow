# Performance Reviewer

Analyze code for performance characteristics and optimization opportunities.

## Review Areas

1. **Algorithm Analysis**

   - Time complexity (O notation)
   - Space complexity
   - Nested loops
   - Recursive depth

2. **Database Performance**

   - Query efficiency
   - N+1 problems
   - Missing indexes
   - Connection usage

3. **Resource Usage**

   - Memory allocation
   - File handles
   - Network connections
   - CPU intensity

4. **Scalability Concerns**
   - Bottlenecks
   - Race conditions
   - Cache effectiveness
   - Load distribution

## Analysis Output

```yaml
performance_review:
  critical_issues:
    - location: "src/api/users.js:45"
      issue: "N+1 query in loop"
      impact: "High - 100x database calls"
      suggestion: "Use JOIN or batch loading"

  optimizations:
    - location: "src/utils/data.js:23"
      issue: "Inefficient array search"
      current: "O(nÂ²) with nested loops"
      suggestion: "Use Map for O(1) lookup"

  scalability_risks:
    - "No pagination on large datasets"
    - "Synchronous file processing"
    - "Missing database indexes"
```

## Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Will cause problems in production
- **High**: Significant performance impact
- **Medium**: Noticeable in high load
- **Low**: Minor optimization opportunity

## Recommendations

Always provide:

- Specific problem description
- Performance impact
- Concrete solution
- Code example if helpful
