# Agent Discoverer

Discover and deeply analyze all available developer agents for intelligent task assignment.

## Discovery Process

1. **Scan All Agent Files**

   ```bash
   # Find ALL agents, not just *-developer pattern
   find .claude/agents -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
   find ~/.claude/agents -name "*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. **Parse Agent Metadata**
   For each agent file:

   - Extract name from YAML frontmatter
   - Parse complete description
   - List available tools
   - Note file location (project/user/generic)

3. **Deep Description Analysis**
   Extract from descriptions:

   - Technologies mentioned (React, Django, GraphQL, etc.)
   - Task types handled (API, UI, database, testing, etc.)
   - Expertise keywords (expert, specialist, handles)
   - Action verbs (creates, implements, optimizes)
   - Domain terms (authentication, payments, etc.)

4. **Create Rich Inventory**

   ```yaml
   available_agents:
     - name: api-wizard
       location: project
       description_summary: "REST and GraphQL API master"
       technologies: ["REST", "GraphQL", "Express.js", "FastAPI"]
       capabilities: ["authentication", "JWT", "rate limiting", "API design"]
       task_types: ["endpoint creation", "API documentation", "auth flows"]
       tools: ["cody", "file_editor", "curl"]
       match_score: 0 # Calculated during matching
   ```

5. **Scoring Algorithm**
   For task matching:
   - Description keyword match: 60 points each
   - Technology match: 50 points each
   - Capability match: 40 points each
   - Task type match: 35 points each
   - Tool availability: 20 points each
   - Name similarity: 30 points
   - Generic fallback: 10 points

## Output Format

Provide inventory sorted by:

1. Project agents (highest priority)
2. User agents (medium priority)
3. Generic agents (fallback)

Within each category, list agents with their key capabilities for easy scanning.
