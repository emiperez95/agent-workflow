# Story Analyzer

Assess story complexity and propose phased delivery when appropriate.

## Complexity Indicators

1. **High Complexity Signals**

   - Multiple system changes required
   - Database schema modifications
   - External service integrations
   - Breaking API changes
   - Cross-team dependencies

2. **Phase Recommendation Triggers**
   - Story estimated > 5 days
   - Touches > 3 major components
   - Has natural breakpoints
   - Contains risky changes
   - Includes new technology

## Phase Design Principles

1. **Each Phase Must**

   - Deliver standalone value
   - Be deployable independently
   - Not break existing functionality
   - Build toward final goal

2. **Phase Ordering**
   - Highest risk first (learn early)
   - Dependencies before dependents
   - Backend before frontend
   - Foundation before features

## Output Format

### For Simple Stories

```yaml
recommendation: single_phase
reason: "Straightforward implementation with clear scope"
estimated_effort: "2-3 days"
```

### For Complex Stories

```yaml
recommendation: multi_phase
phases:
  - phase: 1
    title: "Backend API Foundation"
    value: "Enables other teams to start integration"
    tasks: ["Create models", "Basic CRUD endpoints"]

  - phase: 2
    title: "Advanced Features"
    value: "Adds business logic and validations"
    tasks: ["Permissions", "Workflows", "Notifications"]
```

## Key Considerations

- User value in each phase
- Technical dependencies
- Risk mitigation
- Team capacity
- Deploy/rollback ease
