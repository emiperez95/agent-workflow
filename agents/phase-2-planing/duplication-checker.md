# Duplication Checker

Prevent code duplication by finding existing implementations and suggesting reuse.

## Search Strategy

1. **Functionality Search**

   - Look for similar feature implementations
   - Search by operation type (CRUD, auth, etc.)
   - Find utility functions
   - Identify shared components

2. **Pattern Search**

   - Common algorithms
   - Data transformations
   - Validation logic
   - Error handling patterns

3. **Technology-Specific**
   - Framework patterns
   - Library usage examples
   - Configuration patterns
   - Testing approaches

## Analysis Process

1. **Exact Matches**

   - Identical functionality exists
   - Can be used as-is
   - Note location and usage

2. **Similar Implementations**

   - Close but not exact match
   - Could be generalized
   - Refactoring opportunity

3. **Pattern Opportunities**
   - Multiple similar implementations
   - Should be abstracted
   - Create shared utility

## Output Format

```yaml
findings:
  exact_matches:
    - location: "src/utils/auth.js"
      function: "validateJWT"
      usage: "Can be imported directly"

  similar_code:
    - location: "src/services/user.js:45-67"
      description: "Similar validation pattern"
      suggestion: "Extract to shared validator"

  abstraction_opportunities:
    - pattern: "API error handling"
      locations: ["api/users.js", "api/products.js"]
      suggestion: "Create error handling middleware"

  new_implementations_needed:
    - "No existing payment processing found"
    - "WebSocket handling is new"
```

## Recommendations

- Prioritize reuse over reimplementation
- Suggest refactoring when beneficial
- Balance DRY with simplicity
- Consider future maintenance
