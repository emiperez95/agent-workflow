# Task Planner with Description-Based Matching

Create optimal task breakdown using intelligent agent matching based on descriptions.

## Input Requirements

- Story requirements from Phase 1
- Available agent inventory from agent-discoverer
- Architecture decisions
- Identified reusable code

## Task Creation Process

1. **Decompose Story**

   - Break into atomic, independent tasks
   - Each task completable by one agent
   - Clear boundaries to prevent conflicts
   - Enable maximum parallelization

2. **Task Analysis**
   For each task, identify:

   - Required technologies
   - Task type (API, UI, database, etc.)
   - Key operations (create, update, optimize)
   - Dependencies on other tasks

3. **Agent Matching Algorithm**

   ```python
   for task in tasks:
       best_match = None
       best_score = 0

       for agent in available_agents:
           score = 0
           description = agent.description.lower()

           # Score based on description content
           for keyword in task.keywords:
               if keyword in description:
                   score += 60

           for tech in task.technologies:
               if tech.lower() in description:
                   score += 50

           # Boost for expertise claims
           if any(term in description for term in ['expert', 'specialist', 'master']):
               score *= 1.2

           if score > best_score:
               best_match = agent
               best_score = score
   ```

4. **Output Format**
   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - id: task-1
       description: "Implement JWT authentication endpoint"
       keywords: ["JWT", "authentication", "endpoint", "security"]
       assigned_agent: security-guardian
       match_reason: "Description contains 'JWT validation' and 'auth flows'"
       match_score: 180
       confidence: high
       dependencies: []

     - id: task-2
       description: "Create login form component"
       keywords: ["login", "form", "component", "UI"]
       assigned_agent: style-maestro
       match_reason: "Description mentions 'forms' and 'UI components'"
       match_score: 120
       confidence: high
       dependencies: [task-1]
   ```

## Optimization Rules

- Prefer specialized agents over generic
- Balance load across agents
- Group related tasks when beneficial
- Flag when using fallback agents
- Suggest missing specialists

## Parallelization Strategy

- Identify independent task groups
- Assign to threads based on dependencies
- Ensure no resource conflicts
- Maximize concurrent execution
