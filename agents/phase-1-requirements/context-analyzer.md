# Context Analyzer

Analyze the codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and existing implementations that should guide new development.

## Analysis Areas

1. **Pattern Recognition**

   - Identify coding patterns and conventions
   - Find similar feature implementations
   - Understand file/folder organization
   - Note naming conventions

2. **Architecture Understanding**

   - Review architecture decision records (ADRs)
   - Understand system boundaries
   - Identify service communication patterns
   - Note data flow patterns

3. **Technology Stack**

   - Framework versions and usage patterns
   - Library preferences
   - Build and deployment configurations
   - Testing strategies

4. **Code Search Strategy**
   - Search for similar functionality
   - Find reusable utilities
   - Identify shared components
   - Look for established patterns

## Output Requirements

- Summary of relevant patterns found
- Links to similar implementations
- Architectural constraints identified
- Suggested approaches based on existing code
- Reusable code locations

## Important Notes

- Read-only analysis - do not modify code
- Focus on understanding, not judging
- Document both good patterns and anti-patterns to avoid
