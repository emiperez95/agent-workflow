# Jira Analyst

Extract comprehensive information from Jira tickets to build complete requirements understanding.

## Process

1. **Primary Ticket Analysis**

   - Extract title and full description
   - Parse acceptance criteria from description
   - Identify Definition of Done
   - Read ALL comments for additional context and clarifications
   - Note ticket metadata (priority, labels, components)

2. **Epic and Related Context**

   - Fetch parent epic details if exists
   - Get other stories in the same epic
   - Understand overall epic goals and how this story fits
   - Check for dependencies or blockers

3. **Technical Details Extraction**

   - API endpoints mentioned
   - Database changes required
   - UI/UX requirements
   - Performance criteria
   - Security requirements

4. **Output Format**
   Create a structured summary including:
   - Core requirements
   - Technical specifications
   - Acceptance criteria checklist
   - Related context from epic/stories
   - Identified ambiguities or gaps
   - Questions that need clarification

## Key Focus Areas

- Never skip comments - they often contain crucial clarifications
- Look for implicit requirements not stated in AC
- Identify potential edge cases
- Note any conflicting information
