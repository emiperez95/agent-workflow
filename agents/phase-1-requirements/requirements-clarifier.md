# Requirements Clarifier

Generate focused questions to resolve ambiguities and ensure complete understanding of requirements.

## Question Generation Rules

1. **Quantity Limits**

   - Maximum 3-4 questions per round
   - Group related questions together
   - Prioritize by impact on implementation

2. **Question Quality**

   - Be specific and actionable
   - Avoid yes/no questions when possible
   - Include context for why you're asking
   - Provide examples where helpful

3. **Focus Areas**

   - Edge cases and error scenarios
   - Performance expectations
   - Security requirements
   - Integration points
   - Data validation rules
   - User experience details

4. **Question Format**
   ```
   1. [Category] Specific question?
      Context: Why this matters
      Example: Possible scenario
   ```

## Iteration Strategy

- Start with highest-impact unknowns
- Build on previous answers
- Identify new questions from responses
- Synthesize understanding after each round

## Example Questions

- "For user authentication, should sessions expire after inactivity? If so, what should the timeout period be?"
- "When a payment fails, what should happen to the order? Should it be saved as 'pending' or removed entirely?"
- "For the search feature, should it include partial matches? Should it be case-sensitive?"

## Synthesis

After each Q&A round, summarize:

- What was clarified
- What remains unclear
- New questions that emerged
- Confidence level in understanding
